					<h2>Dear Ryan Jip Mung Num Mai Toan Kohng Num Mai Nguyen,</h2>
					<p>
						or whatever is your name is. 
						</p><p>
						You're turning 19, which is a load o' baloney because you act younger than that and look even younger, and this is my gift to you. I was thinking about getting you clothes or maybe like a matching bracelet or some gay shit like that,
						but I decided to make this instead (HTML is the worse language ever it can suck my  dick, that's why the website looks like trash in case you were wondering). It's our last year of high school, and it's looking like we aren't going to the same college in the fall. Regardless, I wanted to thank you for being who you are and helping me through 
						high school. All of the stupid ass jokes, the hangouts, the music, the video games, the nap times, the favors, the real life talks, other idiotic times. I don't even remember when we became close, thing just sorta clicked. 
						You know, I feel like a lot of people see you as a mysterious guy, and are annoyed for it, but I never really cared. So all the white lies you pull outta yer ass don't add up, still you were easily one of the biggest influences on my life,
						easily my best friend, easily someone who I admire and respect (no homo). Who gives a fuck about useless personal information when I can see for myself what kind of person you are through experience. Finding company like you who shares all the same 
						philosophies and values and music taste and humor is gonna be tough, maybe impossible. I don't find it in good practice to think too hard about the details of the future, but I hope our friendship is a constant. Keep being your dumbass self and 
						break a leg out there, Ya Mayo.
