					<h2>Pet Rocks</h2>
					<p>
						Gary Ross Dahl devised the perfect pet.

No messes. No allergies. No effort. Just pure, simple solidarity. Dahl’s Pet Rock was a key innovation of the 1970s, tongue-in-cheek humor for a post-Watergate world, a pop culture fad that made its creator lots of money -- and continued to draw bemused attention in the decades that followed.

Dahl, whose death was announced Tuesday at age 78, reportedly stumbled onto his Pet Rock idea while at a bar talking with friends.

Dahl quickly got to work, developing the packaging. The smooth stones rested on a bed of excelsior inside a cardboard box -- featuring air holes for breathing purposes, naturally -- and included a tongue-in-cheek instruction pamphlet for "care and training."

“Your PET ROCK will be a devoted friend and companion for many years to come,” stated Dahl’s booklet, which featured illustrations of the rocks in inaction. "Rocks enjoy a rather long life span so the two of you will never have to part -- at least not on your PET ROCK’s account. Once you have transcended the awkward training stage your rock will mature into a faithful, obedient, loving pet with but one purpose in life -- to be at your side when you want it to, and to go lie down when you don’t."

						Here is an example of a customer that formed an impressive bond with his pet rock, and what he felt upon losing his companion:
						"my pet rock rockky was hit by a car early this morning 
						please can we have a few days to remember how much rockky 
						meant to all of us he was a friend a brother a lover and 
						more inportintly he was a fighter he want out fighting 3 
						inchs of rubber as it crushed the poor souls body RIP rockky 
						i love you forever and ever you will be missed"
